     * We want the number of drops of egg 1 to be the same as the number of drops of egg 2 in this case.
     * To achieve this goal, what we need to do is reduce the interval of egg 1 every time we move up
     * Thus, suppose that egg 1 starts at floor X, then
     *  X + (X - 1) + (X - 2) + ... + 1 = 100
     *  X = 13.65
     *
     * Comparing 13 and 14, we should take number 14
