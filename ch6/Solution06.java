     * Answer:
     *  If there are n people with blue eyes, it will take n nights for them to leave
     *
     *  If n = 1, the one with with blue eyes will notice immediately that all other people have normal eyes,
     *      since there is at least one person with blue eye, thus he will know that he has blue eyes and leave tonight
     *
     *  If n = 2, the two people with blue eyes can see one people with blue eyes. Both of them will wait on the first night
     *      to see if the other one know themselves are the only one with blue eyes. Thus, they'll wait until the second night to leave together.
     *
     *  The same logic applies when n increases.
